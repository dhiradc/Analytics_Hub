##CaseStudy Project Management

This is a sample case study and a proposal I defined. I have tried to include most relevant phases/queries associated to common project deliveries as a TPM/PM:
1. The product has integrations/intersections with other complex products. You have to keep in mind the collaboration need.
2. There are more than one Agile teams working on your product, and multiple Agile teams working on the other connected products.  You need to consider how to manage timelines and keep the project goal and timelines in context.
3. An Agile process with a two-week sprint cycle is preferred. You can use any methodology youâ€™d like (Scrum, Journey, etc.) for your teams but in the proposal, you have to justify your choice.
4. Your projects are scope-driven (must ship with certain features), time-limited (must ship by a certain date), or both. Time management and tracking are of utmost importance here.

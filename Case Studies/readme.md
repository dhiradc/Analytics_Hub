🚀 **CaseStudy Project Management**

Topic: Project delivery steps

This is a sample case study and a proposal I defined. I have tried to include most relevant phases/queries associated to common project deliveries as a TPM/PM:
1. The product has integrations/intersections with other complex products. You have to keep in mind the collaboration need.
2. There are more than one Agile teams working on your product, and multiple Agile teams working on the other connected products.  You need to consider how to manage timelines and keep the project goal and timelines in context.
3. An Agile process with a two-week sprint cycle is preferred. You can use any methodology you’d like (Scrum, Journey, etc.) for your teams but in the proposal, you have to justify your choice.
4. Your projects are scope-driven (must ship with certain features), time-limited (must ship by a certain date), or both. Time management and tracking are of utmost importance here.



🚀 **Automated Employee Onboarding Process**

Topic: Automated Employee Onboarding Process

Description:

Created a Visio process map outlining the end-to-end workflow of automating an employee onboarding process. The goal was to visualize how automation could reduce manual intervention, speed up the process, and ensures consistency by avoiding manual slip ups.

Process Steps:

Pre-Onboarding Phase:

📌 Trigger: HR receives a new hire confirmation.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. After recipt of HR confirmation for onborading, the System generates an offer letter and sends it via DocuSign to the candidate.
2. It also trieggers and Automated background verification request, which will probably be done by a thirda party (this section is not included).

Document Submission & Verification:

📌 Trigger: Candidate uploads required documents.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. Once the docs are received the system manager verifies ID documents using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
2. On Receipt of the status for the uploaded docs, system sends notification is sent to HR.

Account Creation & IT Provisioning:

📌 Trigger: Onboarding status moves to "Verified."

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. Once the "verified" status is confirmed by the HR, the system manager creates Active Directory and email accounts.
2. It also auto-assigns the user id with access to necessary tools (e.g., Jira, Confluence, Slack).
3. IT team receives confirmation with access details from the system manager.

Training & Orientation:

📌 Trigger: New employee’s start date is reached.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. The system now sends welcome emails and calendar invites for training sessions.
2. It also assigns e-learning modules automatically if there are any such modules meant for the onboarded role.

Post-Onboarding Feedback:

📌 Trigger: Employee completes onboarding.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. The new employee sends a feedback survey back to the System Manager.
2. The System Manager collects responses and generates a report for HR.

🎯 Visio Elements Included:

Swim lanes: To represent different departments (HR, IT, System Manager).

Connectors & Arrows: To show the automation flow between systems.

Color Coding: To indicate doer actions easily identifiable.





🚀 **Multithreaded Process Flow**

Topic: Multithreaded Process Flow. 

Description:

The flow illustrates the interaction between three threads: Initiator Thread, Dispatcher Thread, and Worker Thread, and how they collaborate to process commands in a multithreaded system.

Detailed Flow Description

📌 Initiator Thread
1. The thread starts in an idle state.
2. When a user takes an action, the system generates a command and posts it to the Command Queue (FIFO).
3. The thread returns to idle after posting the command.

📌 Dispatcher Thread
1. The thread starts in an idle state and continuously checks the Command Queue for new commands.
2. In case, the queue is empty, the thread remains idle.
3. If there are commands in the queue:
   a. It retrieves and dispatches a command to the Worker Thread for processing.
   b. Handles discrepancies or conflicts using a critical section to ensure thread safety.

📌 Worker Thread
1. This thread receives the commands from the Dispatcher Thread.
2. It then processes each command independently.
3. Once the task is completed, it awaits further commands.

Key Components: These components are considered key as they maintain the main flow and the fallback mecahnism handling.

1. Command Queue (FIFO):
   
   a. A shared queue where commands are stored in a first-in, first-out order.
   
   b. Acts as a buffer between Initiator and Dispatcher threads.

2. Critical Section:
   
   a. A mechanism to handle discrepancies or race conditions when accessing shared resources (e.g., Command Queue).
   
   b. Ensures thread-safe operations in a multithreaded environment.

🎯 Use Case Scenarios:

Task Scheduling Systems: Where tasks are queued and processed asynchronously by worker threads. Example: Tasks created to make record moves from one stage to another without manual intervention.

Multithreaded Servers: Handling client requests efficiently by delegating tasks to worker threads. For example, a automated ticketing system where messages have to be moved through stages.

🎯 Visio Elements Included:

1. Black Circles: Represent start and end points of each thread's lifecycle.
2. Rectangles: Represent states or actions performed by threads (e.g., idle, process command).
3. Diamond Shape: Represents decision-making logic (e.g., checking if the queue is empty).
4. Red Arrows: Indicate flow of control between states or threads.

🎯 Notes on Implementation:

 It has to be ensured that proper synchronization mechanisms are used to prevent race conditions when accessing shared resources.
 The thread scheduling has to be optimized to avoid bottlenecks in the Dispatcher or Worker Threads.
 Error handling has to be robust within critical sections to manage discrepancies effectively.

This diagram serves as a conceptual guide for designing robust multithreaded systems with clear separation of responsibilities among threads.


🚀 **AI-Powered Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process**

Topic: Created a Visio process map outlining how AI-driven automation enhances the customer support ticket resolution workflow. This map will demonstrate how AI handles ticket classification, routing, and resolution, reducing manual effort and accelerating response times.

📌 Ticket Creation & Categorization: Customer submits a support request via email, chat, or web form.

🤖 AI-Powered Action

1. NLP (Natural Language Processing) analyzes the ticket content. It automatically extracts key details: issue type, urgency, and sentiment.
2. AI bot classifies the category and priority level(eg. Billing, Technical, etc.)

📌 Auto-Routing & Assignment

🤖 AI-Powered Action

1. AI auto-routes the ticket based on: matches the predefined categories. AI Historically routes to the appropriate team based on past issue types.
2. Smart workload balancing ensures tickets are marked for exact department.

📌 Automated Resolution & Self-Service

🤖 AI-Powered Action

1. AI chatbot here suggests automated solutions using a knowledge base.
2. If the issue is simple (e.g., password reset), the Chat Bot provides an instant solution.
3. For complex issues, the bot gathers details and attaches them to the ticket.

📌 Ticket Escalation & Human Intervention: Manual Action

1. The ticket is escalated to a human agent for action.
2. AI assists the agent by providing Contextual data (ticket history, customer profile) and past resolution history.

📌 Ticket Closure & Feedback: Issue is resolved.

1. AI Generates reports and insights on resolution times, customer satisfaction, and edge case. if any (both for ChatBot resolution and manual resolution).
2. Issue is marked resolved.
3. History is updated for this record in the relevant category.

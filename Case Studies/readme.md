#CaseStudy Project Management#

Topic: Project delivery steps

This is a sample case study and a proposal I defined. I have tried to include most relevant phases/queries associated to common project deliveries as a TPM/PM:
1. The product has integrations/intersections with other complex products. You have to keep in mind the collaboration need.
2. There are more than one Agile teams working on your product, and multiple Agile teams working on the other connected products.  You need to consider how to manage timelines and keep the project goal and timelines in context.
3. An Agile process with a two-week sprint cycle is preferred. You can use any methodology you’d like (Scrum, Journey, etc.) for your teams but in the proposal, you have to justify your choice.
4. Your projects are scope-driven (must ship with certain features), time-limited (must ship by a certain date), or both. Time management and tracking are of utmost importance here.





#Automated Employee Onboarding Process#

Topic: Automated Employee Onboarding Process

Description:

Created a Visio process map outlining the end-to-end workflow of automating an employee onboarding process. The goal was to visualize how automation could reduce manual intervention, speed up the process, and ensures consistency by avoiding manual slip ups.

Process Steps:

Pre-Onboarding Phase:

    📌 Trigger: HR receives a new hire confirmation.
    🛠️ Automated Action:
        System generates an offer letter and sends it via DocuSign.
        Automated background verification request is triggered.

Document Submission & Verification:

📌 Trigger: Candidate uploads required documents.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. System verifies ID documents using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
2. Status notification is sent to HR.

Account Creation & IT Provisioning:

📌 Trigger: Onboarding status moves to "Verified."

🛠️ Automated Action:

1.System creates Active Directory and email accounts.
2.Auto-assigns access to necessary tools (e.g., Jira, Confluence, Slack).
3.IT team receives confirmation with access details.

Training & Orientation:

📌 Trigger: New employee’s start date is reached.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. System sends welcome emails and calendar invites for training sessions.
2. Assigns e-learning modules automatically.

Post-Onboarding Feedback:

📌 Trigger: Employee completes onboarding.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. System sends a feedback survey.
2. Collects responses and generates a report for HR.

🎯 Visio Elements Included:

Swim lanes: To represent different departments (HR, IT, Hiring Manager).

Connectors & Arrows: To show the automation flow between systems.

Color Coding: To indicate doer actions easily identifiable.

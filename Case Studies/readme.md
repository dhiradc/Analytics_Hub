🚀 **CaseStudy Project Management**

Topic: Project delivery steps

This is a sample case study and a proposal I defined. I have tried to include most relevant phases/queries associated to common project deliveries as a TPM/PM:
1. The product has integrations/intersections with other complex products. You have to keep in mind the collaboration need.
2. There are more than one Agile teams working on your product, and multiple Agile teams working on the other connected products.  You need to consider how to manage timelines and keep the project goal and timelines in context.
3. An Agile process with a two-week sprint cycle is preferred. You can use any methodology you’d like (Scrum, Journey, etc.) for your teams but in the proposal, you have to justify your choice.
4. Your projects are scope-driven (must ship with certain features), time-limited (must ship by a certain date), or both. Time management and tracking are of utmost importance here.





🚀 **Automated Employee Onboarding Process**

Topic: Automated Employee Onboarding Process

Description:

Created a Visio process map outlining the end-to-end workflow of automating an employee onboarding process. The goal was to visualize how automation could reduce manual intervention, speed up the process, and ensures consistency by avoiding manual slip ups.

Process Steps:

Pre-Onboarding Phase:

📌 Trigger: HR receives a new hire confirmation.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. System generates an offer letter and sends it via DocuSign.
2. Automated background verification request is triggered.

Document Submission & Verification:

📌 Trigger: Candidate uploads required documents.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. System verifies ID documents using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
2. Status notification is sent to HR.

Account Creation & IT Provisioning:

📌 Trigger: Onboarding status moves to "Verified."

🛠️ Automated Action:

1.System creates Active Directory and email accounts.
2.Auto-assigns access to necessary tools (e.g., Jira, Confluence, Slack).
3.IT team receives confirmation with access details.

Training & Orientation:

📌 Trigger: New employee’s start date is reached.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. System sends welcome emails and calendar invites for training sessions.
2. Assigns e-learning modules automatically.

Post-Onboarding Feedback:

📌 Trigger: Employee completes onboarding.

🛠️ Automated Action:

1. System sends a feedback survey.
2. Collects responses and generates a report for HR.

🎯 Visio Elements Included:

Swim lanes: To represent different departments (HR, IT, System Manager).

Connectors & Arrows: To show the automation flow between systems.

Color Coding: To indicate doer actions easily identifiable.


🚀 **Multithreaded Process Flow**

This diagram provides an explanation of the Multithreaded Process Flow. 
The flow illustrates the interaction between three threads: Initiator Thread, Dispatcher Thread, and Worker Thread, and how they collaborate to process commands in a multithreaded system.

Overview of Threads

  📌  Initiator Thread:

        Represents the user or system-initiated actions.

        Responsible for posting commands to the system when a user takes an action.

        Operates in an idle state until an action triggers it.

  📌  Dispatcher Thread:

        Continuously monitors a FIFO (First In, First Out) Command Queue for new commands.

        Dispatches commands to the Worker Thread for processing.

        Returns to an idle state if the queue is empty.

  📌  Worker Thread:

        Handles the actual processing of commands dispatched by the Dispatcher Thread.

        Operates independently to execute tasks without blocking other threads.

Detailed Flow Description

🛠️Initiator Thread

    Starts in an idle state.

    When a user takes an action, the system generates a command and posts it to the Command Queue (FIFO).

    Returns to idle after posting the command.

🛠️Dispatcher Thread

    Starts in an idle state and continuously checks the Command Queue for new commands.

    If the queue is empty, it remains idle.

    If there are commands in the queue:

        It retrieves and dispatches a command to the Worker Thread for processing.

        Handles discrepancies or conflicts using a critical section to ensure thread safety.

🛠️Worker Thread

    Receives commands from the Dispatcher Thread.

    Processes each command independently.

    Completes its task and awaits further commands.

Key Components

1. Command Queue (FIFO):

    A shared queue where commands are stored in a first-in, first-out order.

    Acts as a buffer between Initiator and Dispatcher threads.

2. Critical Section:

    A mechanism to handle discrepancies or race conditions when accessing shared resources (e.g., Command Queue).

    Ensures thread-safe operations in a multithreaded environment.

Use Case Scenarios

    User Interaction Systems: For example, GUI-based applications where user actions trigger background tasks.

    Task Scheduling Systems: Where tasks are queued and processed asynchronously by worker threads.

    Multithreaded Servers: Handling client requests efficiently by delegating tasks to worker threads.

Diagram Legend

    Black Circles: Represent start and end points of each thread's lifecycle.

    Rectangles: Represent states or actions performed by threads (e.g., idle, process command).

    Diamond Shape: Represents decision-making logic (e.g., checking if the queue is empty).

    Red Arrows: Indicate flow of control between states or threads.

Notes on Implementation

    Ensure proper synchronization mechanisms are used to prevent race conditions when accessing shared resources.

    Optimize thread scheduling to avoid bottlenecks in the Dispatcher or Worker Threads.

    Implement error handling within critical sections to manage discrepancies effectively.

This diagram serves as a conceptual guide for designing robust multithreaded systems with clear separation of responsibilities among threads.
